# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-01)

**Core value:** Bidirectional sync between Obsidian vault and Huma dashboard.
**Current focus:** Hardening reconcile against delta-mode bugs.

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (complete)
Plan: 01-02 (complete)
Status: Phase 1 verified — UAT 7/7 pass
Last activity: 2026-05-02 — Phase 1 complete. Reconcile refactored to decide() + UUID-union dispatch (379 → 279 LOC). 21 property-fixture rows added (113 total). Plus session-extension work: stale_local_delete audit event, stale-resolution UI (Restore/Ignore), server-deleted resolution UI (Delete locally/Keep locally), inflight-race fix on direct pulls, settings-tab "Sync now" button, idle status-bar click → sync.

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 1/1)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2 (01-01, 01-02)
- Average duration: ~1 day
- Total execution time: 2026-05-01 to 2026-05-02

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` and `docs/CONFLICT-MATRIX.md`.

### Roadmap Evolution

- 2026-05-01: Project bootstrapped from existing brownfield codebase. ROADMAP scaffolded so phases can be added.
- 2026-05-01: Phase 1 added — Refactor reconcile to single decide() function backed by exhaustive matrix property tests.
- 2026-05-02: Phase 1 complete + verified (UAT 7/7 pass). Session extended into observability + resolution UX work (not in original phase scope) — see Pending Todos for follow-ups that warrant their own phases.
- 2026-05-02: Phase 2 added — Onboarding and packaging for non-technical users. Triggered by upcoming user-onboarding tomorrow. Closes four gaps: silent first enable, the 10s sign-in Notice, orphaned tokens on disable, and missing registry/BRAT visual. 4 plans: token cleanup on disable, sign-in modal, first-run welcome modal, settings polish + default URL + README icon.

### Pending Todos

- **Server-side un-archive surfacing (cross-stack).** Server fix: bump `vault_files.updated_at` when `documents.archived_at` flips back to NULL so plugin's `since`-filtered manifest fetch surfaces un-archive. Plugin follow-up: drop the un-archive warning copy from the server-deleted resolution modal once the server change ships. Owner: server team has confirmed scope; one-line edit on the un-archive path.
- **Capture session-extension work as a phase.** This session shipped substantially more than Phase 1 promised: `stale_local_delete` audit event, stale-resolution UI (Restore + Ignore + ignoredStaleIds filter + inflight-race fix), server-deleted resolution UI (Delete locally + Keep locally + pendingServerDeletes), settings-tab "Sync now" button, idle-state status-bar click → sync. Worth retroactively documenting as Phase 2 ("Surface and resolve sync-state warnings") so the work has a UAT artifact and the ROADMAP reflects it. Files in commit c196875.
- **v1.1 delete-sync (deferred).** Local delete → server tombstone push. Per CONFLICT-MATRIX § "Out of scope". Largest deferred item; pairs naturally with the un-archive surfacing fix.
- Other deferred items in `docs/CONFLICT-MATRIX.md § "Out of scope / deferred"`: concurrent rename-rename, bodies > 6 MB chunked upload, tombstone-then-recreate UUID reuse, per-request abort on plugin unload, multi-device simultaneous renames, folder-level operations.
